## Have a Try

Download [xplaceholder-demo.apk](https://github.com/hust201010701/XPlaceHolder/blob/master/apk/xplaceholder-demo.apk).

## Getting Started

We need to take 3 steps to show placeholder for activty or view.

### 1. Add library

Add below code to your `build.gradle`: `compile 'com.orzangleli:xplaceholder:1.0.0'``

### 2. Configuring custom layout

Different apps have different fail, empty and loading layout.So you need to configure
your own placeholder layout.

#### 1. Create your own Entity class for placeholder

You can add some variables in your class.

For more details, you can refer [ImageAndTextPlaceHolderVo.java](https://github.com/hust201010701/XPlaceHolder/blob/master/app/src/main/java/com/orzangleli/xplaceholder/placeholder/ImageAndTextPlaceHolderVo.java)

#### 2. Implements IPlaceHolderLayout

You need to implements all methods of `IPlaceHolderLayout`. Be careful, `bindView` is not be called when initializing, `bindView` is be call when the first time you show empty, error, or loading layout.So when you override `bindState`, you need to check whether view is null.

For more details, you can refer [ImageAndTextPlaceHolderLayout.java](https://github.com/hust201010701/XPlaceHolder/blob/master/app/src/main/java/com/orzangleli/xplaceholder/placeholder/ImageAndTextPlaceHolderLayout.java).
